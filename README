How to install:
  1. Install Autokey.
  2. Download this folder and put it in the data/ folder of your autokey
     installation. (Mine is ~/.config/autokey/data, yours might be something
     different).
  3. Run the script generator.py.  Two files will be created for each pairing
     of a Toaq root and a Toaq tone, one of the form toaq1.py, the other of the
     form .toaq1.json.
  4. Restart Autokey.  It will take a few seconds to boot up, due to the number
     of abbreviations that have been created.

Usage:
    While Autokey is running, type a Toaq root followed by a digit 1-7.  The
    diacritic corresponding to that tone will appear over the root in the
    appropriate position.

Example:
    Typing "toaq4" will result in "toÌ‰aq".

Note:
    This will only work in environments where CTRL-V results in a paste action
    occurring (the script works by putting the unicode character onto the
    system clipboard and sending CTRL-V to paste it, then restoring the
    clipboard's previous contents).
