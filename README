Download this folder and put it in the data/ folder of your autokey installation.  (Mine is ~/.config/autokey/data, yours might be something different.)  You will probably need to restart autokey for the abbreviations to take effect.

Usage: While Autokey is running, type a vowel [aeiou] followed by a digit [1-7] and the Toaq tone marking corresponding to that digit will appear over the vowel.

Example: Typing "da4q" will result in "daÌ‰q".

Note: Autokey is dumb; a separate script is required for each vowel/tone pairing.  The files toaq_script_template.py and toaq_script_generator.py were used to produce these scripts programmatically.
