How to install:
  1. Install Autokey.
  2. Download this folder and put it in the data/ folder of your autokey
     installation. (Mine is ~/.config/autokey/data, yours might be something
     different).
  3. Run the script generator.py.  A number of files will be created, with
     names like "a1.py" and ".e4.json".

Usage:
    While Autokey is running, type a vowel [aeiou] followed by a digit [1-7]
    and the diacritic mark corresponding to that Toaq tone will appear over
    the vowel.

Example:
    Typing "da4q" will result in "daÌ‰q".

Note:
    This will only work in environments where CTRL-V results in a paste action
    occurring (the script works by putting the unicode character onto the
    system clipboard and sending CTRL-V to paste it, then restoring the
    clipboard's previous contents).
