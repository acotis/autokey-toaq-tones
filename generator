# IDEAS I HAVE ALREADY HAD 
#
#   1. I can't use just endings instead of whole words because
#      then typing "toaq4" yields "toảq" instead of "tỏaq".
#
#   2. I can't use full letter-with-diacritic unicode characters
#      in place of combining diacritics because then it would
#      not work with capital letters.

# Associate numbers with their combining diacritics (the 8th tone has no diacritic)
diacritics = {
    'a': ".āáǎảâàãa",
    'e': ".ēéěẻêèẽe",

    'o': ".ōóǒỏôòõo",
    'u': ".ūúǔủûùũu",
